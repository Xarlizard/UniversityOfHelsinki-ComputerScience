## Start the application

To start the application, do the following:

```bash

$ npm install
# Start the nodemon-server
$ npm run dev
```

You can then access the nodemon-server on: http://localhost:3001/  (port may be already in use, check terminal when running `npm run dev`).

The frontend build is at `dist` directory (literally a Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V from `..\Part-02\phonebook` project, in case you want to understand the code behind it, only an `npm run build` has been applied there)
