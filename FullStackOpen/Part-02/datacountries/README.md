Simple web applicaton for understanding the core concepts of React, AXIOS (http requests) method, JSON handling and basic API interactions.

## Start the application

First, create a `.env.development` file on the root directory containing `VITE_WEATHER_KEY=` followed without whitespaces from your OpenWeather API key. If you don't have one, you can get one for free [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) (free tier only allows 1.000 requests per day, keep that in mind!).

Then, to start the application, do the following:

```bash
# Install dependancies
$ npm install
# Start the application
$ npm run dev
```

You can then access the app on: http://localhost:5173/  (localhost port may vary, check terminal if needed).
